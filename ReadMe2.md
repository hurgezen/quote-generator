Project Overview: Parts Management and Quote Generation System

1. Purpose and Goals:
Our project aims to create a comprehensive web-based system for managing parts data, customer information, and generating quotes. The main goals are:

1. Allow users to upload and manage parts data from CSV files
2. Maintain a customer database
3. Create and manage quotes for customers
4. Display parts and customer information in user-friendly lists
5. Provide functionality to refresh and update data



2. Technologies Used:

1. Next.js 13+ (with App Router): For building the full-stack React application
2. React: For building the user interface components
3. Prisma: As an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for database operations
4. Tailwind CSS: For styling the components
5. Lucide React: For icons
6. csv-parse: For parsing CSV files
7. Vercel: For deployment and hosting (assumed, as it's commonly used with Next.js)



3. Key Components:
a. Frontend:

1. PartsList component: Page for parts management and CSV import
2. CustomerList component: Page for displaying and managing customer information
3. CreateQuote component: Form for creating new quotes
4. HeaderMapping component: For mapping CSV headers to database fields
5. MainLayout component: For consistent layout across pages


b. Backend:

1. API routes:

1. /api/parts: For fetching and managing parts data
2. /api/import-parts: For handling CSV file uploads and processing
3. /api/customers: For managing customer data
4. /api/quotes: For creating and managing quotes
5. /api/debug: For viewing raw database contents (added for troubleshooting)





c. Database:

1. Part model: Represents the structure of a part in the database
2. Customer model: Represents customer information
3. Quote model: Represents quote data, including relationships to customers and parts



4. Workflow:
Parts Management:

1. User uploads a CSV file through the PartsList component
2. The file is sent to the /api/import-parts endpoint
3. The CSV is parsed, and its headers are extracted
4. User maps the CSV headers to the appropriate database fields
5. Mapped data is processed and stored in the database
6. The parts list is refreshed to display the newly imported data


Customer Management:

1. Users can view, add, edit, and delete customer information through the CustomerList component
2. Customer data is managed via the /api/customers endpoint


Quote Creation:

1. Users navigate to the CreateQuote component
2. The form allows selection of a customer from the existing database
3. Users can add multiple parts to the quote, with quantity and pricing information
4. The form calculates totals based on part quantities and prices
5. On submission, the quote is saved to the database via the /api/quotes endpoint



5. Challenges Encountered:

1. CSV parsing issues: Ensuring correct parsing of different CSV formats
2. Data mapping: Creating a flexible system for mapping CSV headers to database fields
3. Empty fields handling: Properly handling and displaying parts with missing information
4. Re-upload functionality: Implementing the ability to re-upload and replace existing data
5. Performance optimization: Ensuring efficient processing of large CSV files
6. Error handling: Implementing robust error handling for various scenarios
7. State management: Managing complex form state in the CreateQuote component
8. Data relationships: Properly setting up and managing relationships between customers, quotes, and parts



6. Current Status:

1. Basic CSV upload and import functionality implemented for parts
2. Parts list display working, but with some issues in data presentation
3. Customer listing and management features implemented
4. Quote creation form created with customer selection and parts addition
5. Basic quote calculation logic implemented
6. Debugging features added to help identify data inconsistencies
7. Working on improving data mapping and validation processes



7. Next Steps:

1. Refine the CSV parsing and data mapping process
2. Implement more robust error handling and user feedback across all components
3. Optimize database operations for better performance with large datasets
4. Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive experience, especially in the quote creation process
5. Implement data validation and cleansing features for all input forms
6. Add user authentication and authorization features
7. Develop a quote management interface for viewing and editing existing quotes
8. Implement a dashboard for overview of parts, customers, and quotes
